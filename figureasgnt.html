            <figcaption><big><i>Luck shined on Ashika, and she got a chance that would define a journey in the film
                        industry. She got a chance to act as a leading actress in her first film "Crazy Boy," which was
                        released in 2016, and she was paired with Dilip Prakash (who was a leading actor in that movie).
                        The director of this movie was Mahesh Babu (not to be confused with the actor Mahesh Babu); this
                        romantic comedy narrates the tale of Arjun (played by Dilip Prakash), an orphan whose journey
                        shows that of a fearless young man; fate intertwines Arjun's life with Nandini (played by Ashika
                        Ranganath), a woman blessed with richness but entangled in the complications of love. But this
                        love story was not accepted by Nandani's brother (P. Ravi Shankar played this role); still,
                        their love story became successful. The movie "Crazy Boy" has made an impression on audiences
                        and the box office. Ashika's exceptional portrayal gave her a unique position at the South
                        Indian International Movie Awards, a reward for her talent.

                        Following her debut, Ashika's journey continued to reach its heights, like a shooting star
                        shining in the night sky. Movies like "Raambo 2" and "Madhagaja" became famous for showing her
                        versatility and acting skills; Raambo 2 was released in 2022, and Madhagaja was released in
                        2023.
